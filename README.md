# War++ / TheGame

Client-server game with custome unit/AI scripting language "TripleS". Motivated by StarCraft/Brood War game, but without artifical 200 units limit ;).

**Warning:**
* The code is published just for fun and old memories.
* The version most likely does not compile.
* Docs are in Czech language, but most comments should be in English

Created as school project at Charles University (MFF UK = [Faculty of Mathematics and Physics](https://www.mff.cuni.cz)) around 2000-2003.

We started as group of friends. We put lots of work into the project (2.5 years solid). We learned a lot. We gained lots of experiences. And 4 of us ended up working for Microsoft in Redmond (some of us still there).
