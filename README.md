# War++ / TheGame

Client-server game with custome unit/AI scripting language "TripleS". Motivated by StarCraft/Brood War game, but without artifical 200 units limit ;).

Created as school project at Charles University (MFF UK = Faculty of Math and Physics) around 2002-2005.

We started as group of friends. We put lots of work into the project (2.5 years solid). We learned a lot. We gained lots of experiences. And 4 of us ended up working for Microsoft in Redmond (some of us still there).
