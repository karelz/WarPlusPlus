TODO:
--------------

- update documentation
  - new CNetworkException type added
  - CreateVirtualConnection() can throw an exception

====================================
FAR FUTURE:

- add network statistics
  - add statistic information functions
  - update statistics in thread functions
  - reconsider sizes in statistics structure (DWORD is sometimes too small!!)
  - adjust sending according to actual state of network (statistics)

- add timer adaptability (according to network statistics)

- change the network constants to variables, load them from the config file

- retry connect to server when it fails (leave it on higher layers?!?!)
  - UNPOSSIBLE...

====================================
FAR FAR FUTURE:

- simplify CNetworkConnection class to contain just link list of CVirtualConnection
  objects, move everything necessary to protected members of CVirtualConnection,
  so GetVirtualConnectionPriority() and many others won't need to browse the whole
  link list...
  - it means to destroy SVirtualConnection structure...

- change TCP -> UDP
